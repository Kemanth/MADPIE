# MADPIE

Course Code: CS822

Assignment: #GP2

Maximum and Average queuing Delay with Proportional Integral controller Enhanced (MADPIE) [1] is an extension of PIE [2], that adds deterministic packet drops at controlled intervals. PIE uses a proportional integral controller to maintain the average queuing delay at a desired level. For a large Round Trip Times (RTT) result in large spikes in queuing delays, which induce high dropping probability and low utilization. To deal with this problem, proposed MADPIE.
